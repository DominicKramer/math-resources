	<title>Rings</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>Up to this point we have studied sets with a single binary operation satisfying certain axioms, but often we are more interested in working with sets that have two binary operations.  For example, one of the most natural algebraic structures to study is the integers with the operations of addition and multiplication. These operations are related to one another by the distributive property. If we consider a set with two such related binary operations satisfying certain axioms, we have an algebraic structure called a ring. In a ring we add and multiply such elements as real numbers, complex numbers, matrices, and functions.</p>

		<title>Rings</title>

		<p>A nonempty set <m>R</m> is a <term>ring</term><index><main>Ring</main><sub>definition of</sub></index> if it has two closed binary operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying the following conditions.
			<ol>

 				<li><m>a + b = b + a</m> for <m>a, b \in R</m>.</li>

 				<li><m>(a + b) + c = a + ( b + c)</m> for <m>a, b, c  \in R</m>.</li>

 				<li>There is an element <m>0</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>a + 0 = a</m> for all <m>a \in R</m>.</li>

 				<li>For every element <m>a \in R</m>, there exists an element <m>-a</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>a + (-a) = 0</m>.</li>

 				<li><m>(ab)  c = a  ( b  c)</m> for <m>a, b, c  \in R</m>.</li>

 				<li>For <m>a, b, c \in R</m>,
					<md>
						<mrow>a( b + c)&amp;= ab +ac</mrow>
						<mrow>(a + b)c &amp; = ac + bc.</mrow>
					</md></li>
			</ol>
		This last condition, the distributive axiom, relates the binary operations of addition and multiplication. Notice that the first four axioms simply require that a ring be an abelian group under addition, so we could also have defined a ring to be an abelian group <m>(R, +)</m> together with a second binary operation satisfying the fifth and sixth conditions given above.</p> 

 
		<p>If there is an element <m>1 \in R</m> such that <m>1 \neq 0</m> and  <m>1a = a1 = a</m> for each element <m>a \in R</m>, we say that <m>R</m> is a ring with <term> unity</term><index><main>Ring</main><sub>with unity</sub></index> or <term>identity</term><index><main>Ring</main><sub>with identity</sub></index>.

		<example xml:id="example-ring-integers">
			<p>As we have mentioned previously, the integers form a ring. In fact, <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is an integral domain.  Certainly if <m>a b = 0</m> for two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, either <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m>. However, <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is not a field. There is no integer that is the multiplicative inverse of 2, since <m>1/2</m> is not an integer.  The only integers with multiplicative inverses are 1 and <m>-1</m>.</p>
		</example>
 
 		<example xml:id="example-ring-field">
 			<p>Under the ordinary operations of addition and multiplication, all of the familiar number systems are rings: the rationals, <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>; the real numbers, <m>{\mathbb R}</m>; and the complex numbers, <m>{\mathbb C}</m>. Each of these rings is a field.</p>
 		</example>
 
 		<example xml:id="example-ring-zn">
 			<p>We can define the product of two elements <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> by <m>ab \pmod{n}</m>. For instance, in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>,  <m>5 \cdot 7 \equiv 11 \pmod{12}</m>.  This product makes the abelian group <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> into a ring. Certainly <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> is a commutative ring; however, it may fail to be an integral domain.  If we consider <m>3 \cdot 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{12}</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>, it is easy to see that a product of two  nonzero elements in the ring can be equal to zero.</p>
 		</example>

 		<p>A nonzero element <m>a</m> in a ring <m>R</m> is called a <term>zero divisor</term><index><main>Zero divisor</main></index> if there is a nonzero element <m>b</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>ab = 0</m>. In the previous example,  3 and 4 are zero divisors in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>.</p>
 
 		<example xml:id="example-ring-functions">
			<p>In calculus the continuous real-valued functions on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> form a commutative ring. We add or multiply two functions by  adding or multiplying the values of the functions.  If <m>f(x) = x^2</m> and <m>g(x) = \cos x</m>, then <m>(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) = x^2 + \cos x</m> and <m>(fg)(x) = f(x) g(x) = x^2 \cos x</m>.</p>

 		<example xml:id="example-matrix-ring">
 			<p>The <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices  with entries in <m>{\mathbb R}</m> form a ring under the usual operations of matrix addition and multiplication. This ring is noncommutative, since it is usually the case that <m>AB \neq BA</m>. Also, notice that we can have <m>AB = 0</m> when neither <m>A</m> nor <m>B</m> is zero.</p>

			Though multiplication looks complicated, it is actually a straightforward computation if we remember that we just add and multiply elements in <m>{\mathbb H}</m> like polynomials and keep in mind the relationships between the generators <m>{\mathbf i}</m>, <m>{\mathbf j}</m>, and <m>{\mathbf k}</m>. The ring <m>{\mathbb H}</m> is called the ring of <term> quaternions</term><index><main>Quaternions</main></index>.</p>

<!-- Subscript error corrected.  Suggested by K. Halasz. -->
<!-- TWJ 2/6/2013  -->

			<p>To show that the quaternions are a division ring, we must be able to find an inverse for each nonzero element. Notice that 
				<me>( a + b {\mathbf i}  + c {\mathbf j} +d {\mathbf k} )( a - b {\mathbf i}  - c {\mathbf j} -d {\mathbf k} ) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2.</me>
			This element can be zero only if <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, and <m>d</m> are all zero. So if <m>a + b {\mathbf i}  + c {\mathbf j} +d {\mathbf k} \neq 0</m>,
				<me>
				( a + b {\mathbf i}  + c {\mathbf j} +d {\mathbf k} )\left( \frac{a - b {\mathbf i} - c {\mathbf j} - d {\mathbf k} }{ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 } \right) = 1.</me></p>

		<title>Integral Domains and Fields</title>
 
		<p>Let us briefly recall some definitions. If <m>R</m> is a ring and <m>r</m> is a nonzero element in <m>R</m>, then <m>r</m> is said to  be a <term>zero divisor</term> if there is some nonzero element <m>s \in R</m> such that <m>rs = 0</m>. A commutative ring with identity is said to be an <term>integral domain</term> if it has no zero divisors.  If an element <m>a</m> in a ring <m>R</m> with identity has a multiplicative inverse, we say that <m>a</m> is a <term> unit</term>. If every nonzero element in a ring <m>R</m> is a unit, then <m>R</m> is called a <term>division ring</term>.  A commutative division ring is called a <term>field</term>.</p>

It is easily seen that the Gaussian integers are a subring of the complex numbers since they are closed under addition and multiplication. Let <m>\alpha = a + bi</m> be a unit in <m>{\mathbb Z}[ i ]</m>. Then <m>\overline{\alpha} = a - bi</m> is also a unit since if <m>\alpha \beta = 1</m>, then <m>\overline{\alpha} \overline{\beta} = 1</m>. If <m>\beta = c + di</m>, then   
				<me>1 = \alpha \beta \overline{\alpha} \overline{\beta} = (a^2 + b^2 )(c^2 + d^2).</me>
			Therefore, <m>a^2 + b^2</m> must either be 1 or <m>-1</m>; or, equivalently, <m>a + bi = \pm 1</m> or <m>a+ bi = \pm i</m>.

		<p>The following surprising theorem is due to Wedderburn.</p>
 
		<theorem>
			<statement>
				<p>Every finite integral domain is a field.</p>
			</statement>
		</theorem>
 
		<proof>
			<p>Let <m>D</m> be a finite integral domain and <m>D^\ast</m> be the set of nonzero elements of <m>D</m>.  We must show that every element in <m>D^*</m> has an inverse. For each <m>a \in D^\ast</m> we can define a map <m>\lambda_a : D^\ast \rightarrow D^\ast</m> by <m>\lambda_a(d) = ad</m>.  This map makes sense, because if  <m>a \neq 0</m> and <m>d \neq 0</m>, then <m>ad \neq 0</m>.  The map <m>\lambda_a</m> is one-to-one, since for <m>d_1, d_2 \in D^*</m>, 
				<me>ad_1 = \lambda_a(d_1) = \lambda_a(d_2) = ad_2</me>
			implies <m>d_1 = d_2</m> by left cancellation. Since <m>D^\ast</m> is a finite set, the map <m>\lambda_a</m> must also be onto; hence, for some <m>d \in D^\ast</m>, <m>\lambda_a(d) = ad = 1</m>. Therefore, <m>a</m> has a left inverse. Since <m>D</m> is commutative, <m>d</m> must also be a right inverse for <m>a</m>. Consequently, <m>D</m> is a field.</p>

			<statement>
				<p>The characteristic of an integral domain is either prime or zero.</p>

				<p>Let <m>D</m> be an integral domain and suppose that the characteristic of <m>D</m> is <m>n</m> with <m>n \neq 0</m>. If <m>n</m> is not prime, then <m>n = ab</m>, where <m>1 \lt a \lt n</m> and <m>1 \lt b \lt n</m>. By Lemma<nbsp /><xref ref="lemma-ring-characteristic" />, we need only consider the case <m>n 1 = 0</m>.  Since <m>0 = n 1 = (ab)1 = (a1)(b1)</m> and there are no zero divisors in <m>D</m>, either <m>a1 =0</m> or <m>b1=0</m>.

		<p>In group theory we found that normal subgroups play a special role. These subgroups have nice characteristics that make them more interesting to study than arbitrary subgroups.

			<p>In this particular section we are especially interested in certain ideals of commutative rings. These ideals give us special types of factor rings. More specifically, we would like to characterize those ideals <m>I</m> of a commutative ring <m>R</m> such that <m>R/I</m> is an integral domain or a field.</p> 
	 
	 		<p>A proper ideal <m>M</m> of a ring <m>R</m> is a <term>maximal ideal</term><index><main>Ideal</main><sub>maximal</sub></index><index><main>Maximal ideal</main></index> of <m>R</m> if the ideal <m>M</m> is not a proper subset of any ideal of <m>R</m> except <m>R</m> itself. That is, <m>M</m> is a  maximal ideal if for any ideal <m>I</m> properly containing <m>M</m>, <m>I = R</m>. The following theorem completely characterizes maximal ideals for commutative rings with identity in terms of their corresponding factor rings.</p>

			<theorem xml:id="theorem-maximal-ideal-field">
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with identity and <m>M</m> an ideal in <m>R</m>. Then <m>M</m> is a maximal ideal of <m>R</m> if and only if <m>R/M</m> is a field.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>Let <m>M</m> be a maximal ideal in <m>R</m>. If <m>R</m> is a commutative ring, then <m>R/M</m> must also be a commutative ring.  Clearly, <m>1 + M</m> acts as an identity for <m>R/M</m>. We must also show that every nonzero element in <m>R/M</m> has an inverse.  If <m>a + M</m> is a nonzero element in <m>R/M</m>, then <m>a \notin M</m>. Define <m>I</m> to be the set <m>\{ ra + m : r \in R \text{ and } m \in M \}</m>. We will show that <m>I</m> is an ideal in <m>R</m>. The set <m>I</m> is nonempty since <m>0a+0=0</m> is in <m>I</m>. If <m>r_1 a + m_1</m> and <m>r_2 a + m_2</m> are two elements in <m>I</m>, then

					is in <m>I</m>. Also, for any <m>r \in R</m> it is true that <m>rI \subset I</m>; hence, <m>I</m> is closed under multiplication and satisfies the necessary conditions to be an ideal. Therefore, by Proposition<nbsp /><xref ref="prop-subring" /> and the definition of an ideal, <m>I</m> is an ideal properly containing <m>M</m>. Since <m>M</m> is a maximal ideal, <m>I=R</m>; consequently, by the definition of <m>I</m> there must be an <m>m</m> in <m>M</m> and a <m>b</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>1=ab+m</m>. Therefore,

					<p>Conversely, suppose that <m>M</m> is an ideal and <m>R/M</m> is a field. Since <m>R/M</m> is a field, it must contain at least two elements: <m>0 + M = M</m> and <m>1 + M</m>. Hence, <m>M</m> is a proper ideal of <m>R</m>.  Let <m>I</m> be any ideal properly containing <m>M</m>. We need to show that <m>I = R</m>. Choose <m>a</m> in <m>I</m> but not in <m>M</m>. Since <m>a+ M</m> is a nonzero element in a field, there exists an element <m>b +M</m> in <m>R/M</m> such that <m>(a+M)(b+M) = ab + M = 1+M</m>.  Consequently, there exists an element <m>m \in M</m> such that <m>ab + m = 1</m> and <m>1</m> is in <m>I</m>. Therefore, <m>r1 =r \in I</m> for all <m>r \in R</m>. Consequently, <m>I = R</m>.</p>

			<title>Historical Note</title>

			<p>Amalie Emmy Noether<index><main>Noether, A. Emmy</main></index>, one of the  outstanding mathematicians of the twentieth century, was born in Erlangen, Germany in 1882. She was the daughter of Max Noether<index><main>Noether, Max</main></index> (1844<ndash />1921), a distinguished mathematician at the University of Erlangen. Together with Paul Gordon (1837<ndash />1912), Emmy Noether's father strongly influenced her early education. She entered the University of Erlangen at the age of 18. Although women had been admitted to universities in England, France, and Italy for decades, there was great resistance to their presence at universities in Germany. Noether was one of only two women among the university's 986 students. After completing her doctorate under Gordon in 1907, she continued to do research at Erlangen, occasionally lecturing when her father was ill.</p>

			<p>Noether went to Göttingen to study in 1916. David Hilbert<index><main>Hilbert, David</main></index> and Felix Klein<index><main>Klein, Felix</main></index> tried unsuccessfully to secure her an appointment at Göttingen. Some of the faculty objected to women lecturers, saying, <q>What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and are expected to learn at the feet of a woman?</q>  Hilbert, annoyed at the question, responded, <q>Meine Herren, I do not see that the sex of a candidate is an argument against her admission as a Privatdozent. After all, the Senate is not a bathhouse.</q>  At the end of World War I, attitudes changed and conditions greatly improved for women.  After Noether passed her habilitation examination in 1919, she was given a title and was paid a small sum for her lectures.</p>
 
			<p>In 1922, Noether became a Privatdozent at Göttingen. Over the next 11 years she used axiomatic methods to develop an abstract theory of rings and ideals. Though she was not good at lecturing, Noether was an inspiring teacher. One of her many students was B. L. van der Waerden, author of the first text treating abstract algebra from a modern point of view. Some of the other mathematicians  Noether influenced or closely worked with were Alexandroff, Artin, Brauer, Courant, Hasse, Hopf, Pontryagin, von Neumann, and Weyl. One of the high points of her career was an invitation to address the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich in 1932. In spite  of all the recognition she received from her colleagues, Noether's abilities were never recognized as they should have been during her lifetime. She was never promoted to full professor by the Prussian academic bureaucracy.</p>
 
			<p>In 1933, Noether, a Jew, was banned from participation in all academic activities in Germany. She emigrated to the United States, took a position at Bryn Mawr College, and became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Noether died suddenly on April 14, 1935. After her death she was eulogized by such notable scientists as Albert Einstein.</p>

		<title>An Application to Software Design</title>
 
 		<p>The Chinese Remainder Theorem is a result from elementary number theory about the solution of systems of simultaneous congruences. The Chinese mathematician Sun-tsï wrote about the theorem in the first century A.D. This theorem has some interesting consequences in the design of software for parallel processors.</p>
 
		<lemma xml:id="lemma-chinese-remainder">
			<statement>
				<p>Let <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> be positive integers such that <m>\gcd( m, n) = 1</m>. Then for <m>a, b \in {\mathbb Z}</m> the system
					<md>
						<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  a \pmod{m}</mrow>
						<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  b \pmod{n} </mrow>
					</md>
				has a solution.  If <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are two solutions of the system, then  <m>x_1 \equiv x_2 \pmod{mn}</m>.</p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>The equation <m>x \equiv a \pmod{m}</m> has a solution since <m>a + km</m> satisfies the equation for all <m>k \in {\mathbb Z}</m>.  We must show that there exists an integer <m>k_1</m> such that 
					<me>a + k_1 m \equiv b \pmod{n}.</me>
				This is equivalent to showing that 
					<me>k_1 m \equiv (b-a) \pmod{n}</me>
				has a solution for <m>k_1</m>.  Since <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are relatively prime, there exist integers <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> such that <m>ms + nt = 1</m>. Consequently, 
					<me>(b-a) ms = (b-a) -(b-a) nt,</me>
				or 
					<me>[(b-a)s]m \equiv (b-a) \pmod{n}.</me>
				Now let <m>k_1 = (b-a)s</m>.</p>
 
				<p>To show that any two solutions are congruent modulo <m>mn</m>, let <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> be two solutions of  the system. That is,
					<md>
						<mrow>c_i &amp; \equiv  a \pmod{m}</mrow>
						<mrow>c_i &amp; \equiv  b \pmod{n}</mrow>
					</md>
				for <m>i = 1, 2</m>. Then
					<md>
						<mrow>c_2 &amp; \equiv  c_1 \pmod{m}</mrow>
						<mrow>c_2 &amp; \equiv  c_1 \pmod{n}.</mrow>
					</md>
				Therefore, both <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> divide <m>c_1 - c_2</m>. Consequently, <m>c_2 \equiv c_1 \pmod{mn}</m>.</p>
			</proof>			
		</lemma>

		<example xml:id="example-solve-system">
			<p>Let us solve the system
				<md>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  3 \pmod{4}</mrow>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  4 \pmod{5}.</mrow>
				</md>
			Using the Euclidean algorithm, we can find integers <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> such that <m>4s + 5t = 1</m>. Two such integers are <m>s = 4</m> and <m>t = -3</m>. Consequently,
				<me>x = a + k_1 m = 3 + 4k_1 = 3 + 4[(5 - 4)4] = 19.</me></p>

		<theorem>
			<title>Chinese Remainder Theorem</title>
			<index><main>Chinese Remainder Theorem</main><sub>for integers</sub></index>
			<statement>
				<p>Let <m>n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k</m> be positive integers such that <m>\gcd(n_i, n_j) = 1</m> for <m>i \neq j</m>. Then for any integers <m>a_1, \ldots, a_k</m>, the system
					<md>
						<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  a_1 \pmod{n_1}</mrow>
						<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  a_2 \pmod{n_2}</mrow>
						<mrow>&amp;  \vdots </mrow>
						<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  a_k \pmod{n_k}</mrow>
					</md>
				has a solution.  Furthermore, any two solutions of the system are congruent modulo <m>n_1 n_2 \cdots n_k</m>.</p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>We will use mathematical induction on the number of equations in the system. If there are <m>k= 2</m> equations, then the theorem is true by  Lemma<nbsp /><xref ref="lemma-chinese-remainder" />. Now suppose that the result is true for a system of <m>k</m>  equations or less and that we wish to find a solution of 
					<md>
						<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  a_1 \pmod{n_1}</mrow>
						<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  a_2 \pmod{n_2}</mrow>
						<mrow>&amp; \vdots </mrow>
						<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  a_{k+1} \pmod{n_{k+1}}.</mrow>
					</md>
				Considering the first <m>k</m> equations, there exists a solution that is unique modulo <m>n_1 \cdots n_k</m>, say <m>a</m>. Since <m>n_1 \cdots n_k</m> and <m>n_{k+1}</m> are relatively prime, the system 
					<md>
						<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  a \pmod{n_1 \cdots n_k }</mrow>
						<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  a_{k+1} \pmod{n_{k+1}}</mrow>
					</md>
				has a solution that is unique modulo <m>n_1 \ldots n_{k+1}</m> by the lemma.</p>
			</proof>
		</theorem>
 
		<example xml:id="example-system-mod-4-5-9-7">
			<p>Let us solve the system
				<md>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  3 \pmod{4}</mrow>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  4 \pmod{5}</mrow>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  1 \pmod{9}</mrow>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  5 \pmod{7}.</mrow>
				</md>
			From Example<nbsp /><xref ref="example-solve-system" /> we know that 19 is a solution of the first two congruences and any other solution of the system is congruent to <m>19 \pmod{20}</m>. Hence, we can reduce the system to a system of three congruences:
				<md>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  19 \pmod{20}</mrow>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  1 \pmod{9}</mrow>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  5 \pmod{7}.</mrow>
				</md>
			Solving the next two equations, we can reduce the system to
				<md>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  19 \pmod{180}</mrow>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  5 \pmod{7}.</mrow>
				</md>
			Solving this last system, we find that 19 is a solution for the system that is unique up to modulo 1260.</p>
		</example>
 
		<p>One interesting application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem in the design of computer software is that the theorem allows us to break up a calculation involving large integers into several less formidable calculations. Most computers will handle integer calculations only up to a certain size.  For example, the largest integer available on many workstations is <m>2^{31} - 1 = \mbox{2,147,483,647}</m>.  Special software is required for calculations involving larger integers which  cannot be added directly by the machine.  However, by using the Chinese Remainder Theorem we can break down large integer additions and multiplications into calculations that the computer can handle directly. This is especially useful on parallel processing computers which have the ability to run several programs concurrently.</p>
 
		<p>Most computers have a single central processing unit (CPU), which can only add two numbers at a time. To add  a list of ten numbers, the CPU must do nine additions in sequence. However, a parallel processing computer has more than one CPU. A computer with 10 CPUs, for example,  can perform 10 different additions at the same time. If we can take a large integer  and break it down into parts, sending each part to a different CPU, then by performing several additions or multiplications simultaneously on those parts, we can work with an integer that the computer would not be able to handle as a whole.</p>

		<example xml:id="example-2134x1531">
			<p>Suppose that we wish to multiply 2134 by 1531. We will use the integers 95, 97, 98, and 99 because they are relatively prime. We can break down each integer into four parts:
				<md>
					<mrow>2134 &amp; \equiv  44 \pmod{95}</mrow>
					<mrow>2134 &amp; \equiv  0 \pmod{97}</mrow>
					<mrow>2134 &amp; \equiv  76 \pmod{98}</mrow>
					<mrow>2134 &amp; \equiv  55 \pmod{99}</mrow>
				</md>
			and
				<md>
					<mrow>1531 &amp; \equiv  11 \pmod{95}</mrow>
					<mrow>1531 &amp; \equiv  76 \pmod{97}</mrow>
					<mrow>1531 &amp; \equiv  61 \pmod{98}</mrow>
					<mrow>1531 &amp; \equiv  46 \pmod{99}.</mrow>
				</md>
			Multiplying the corresponding equations, we obtain
				<md>
					<mrow>2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  44 \cdot 11  \equiv  9 \pmod{95}</mrow>
					<mrow>2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  0  \cdot 76  \equiv  0 \pmod{97}</mrow>
					<mrow>2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  76 \cdot 61  \equiv  30 \pmod{98}</mrow>
					<mrow>2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  55 \cdot 46  \equiv 55 \pmod{99}.</mrow>
				</md>
			Each of these four computations can be sent to a different processor if our computer has several CPUs. By the above calculation, we know that <m>2134 \cdot 1531</m> is a solution of the system
				<md>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  9 \pmod{95}</mrow>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  0 \pmod{97}</mrow>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  30 \pmod{98}</mrow>
					<mrow>x &amp; \equiv  55 \pmod{99}.</mrow>
				</md>
			The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that solutions are unique up to modulo <m>95 \cdot 97 \cdot 98 \cdot 99 = \mbox{89,403,930}</m>. Solving this system of congruences for <m>x</m> tells us that <m>2134 \cdot 1531 = \mbox{3,267,154}</m>.</p>
 
			<p>The conversion of the computation into the four subcomputations will take some computing time.  In addition, solving the system of congruences can also take considerable time.  However, if we have many computations to be performed on a particular set of numbers, it makes sense to transform the problem as we have done above and to perform the necessary calculations simultaneously.</p>
