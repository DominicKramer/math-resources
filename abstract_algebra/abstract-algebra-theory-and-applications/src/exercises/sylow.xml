		<statement>
			<p>What are the orders of all Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups where <m>G</m> has order 18, 24, 54, 72, and 80?</p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>If <m>|G| = 18 = 2 \cdot 3^2</m>, then the order of a Sylow 2-subgroup is 2, and the order of a Sylow 3-subgroup is 9. If <m>|G| = 54 = 2 \cdot 3^3</m>, then the order of a Sylow 2-subgroup is 2, and the order of a Sylow 3-subgroup is 27.</p>
		</hint>

	<exercise number="2">
		<statement>
			<p>Find all the Sylow 3-subgroups of <m>S_4</m> and show that they are all conjugate.</p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>The four Sylow 3-subgroups of <m>S_4</m> are <m>P_1 = \{ (1), (123), (132) \}</m>, <m>P_2 = \{ (1), (124), (142) \}</m>, <m>P_3 = \{ (1), (134), (143) \}</m>, <m>P_4 = \{ (1), (234), (243) \}</m>.</p>

	<exercise number="3">
		<statement>
			<p>Show that every group of order 45 has a normal subgroup of order 9.</p>
		</statement>
		
	</exercise>

	<exercise number="4">
		<statement>
			<p>Let <m>H</m> be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>.  Prove that <m>H</m> is the only Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> contained in <m>N(H)</m>. </p>
		</statement>
		
	</exercise>

	<exercise number="5">
		<statement>
			<p>Prove that no group of order 96 is simple.</p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>Since <m>|G| = 96 = 2^5 \cdot 3</m>, <m>G</m> has either one or three Sylow 2-subgroups by the Third Sylow Theorem. If there is only one subgroup, we are done. If there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, let <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> be two of them. <m>|H \cap K| \geq 16</m>; otherwise, <m>HK</m> would have <m>(32 \cdot 32)/8 = 128</m> elements, which is impossible. <m>H \cap K</m> is normal in both <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> since it has index 2 in both groups. Hence, <m>N(H \cap K)</m> contains both <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>. Therefore, <m>|N(H \cap K)|</m> must be a multiple of 32 greater than 1 and still divide 96, so <m>N( H \cap K) = G</m>.</p>

		<statement>
			<p>Prove that no group of order 160 is simple.</p>

	<exercise number="7">
		<statement>
			<p>If <m>H</m> is a normal subgroup of a finite group <m>G</m> and <m>|H| = p^k</m> for some prime <m>p</m>, show that <m>H</m> is contained in every Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. </p>

	<exercise number="8">
		<statement>
			<p>Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>p^2 q^2</m>, where <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are distinct primes such that <m>q \nmid p^2 - 1</m> and <m>p \nmid q^2 - 1</m>. Prove that <m>G</m> must be abelian.  List three pairs of primes satisfying these  conditions. </p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p><m>G</m> has a Sylow <m>q</m>-subgroup of order <m>q^2</m>. Since the number of such subgroups is congruent to 1 modulo <m>q</m> and divides <m>p^2 q^2</m>, there must be either 1, <m>p</m>, or <m>p^2</m> Sylow <m>q</m>-subgroups. Since <m>q \nmid p^2 -1 = (p-1)(p + 1)</m>, there can be only one Sylow <m>q</m>-subgroup, say <m>Q</m>. Similarly, we can show that there is a single Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup <m>P</m>. Every element in <m>Q</m> other than the identity has order <m>q</m> or <m>q^2</m>, so <m>P \cap Q = \{ e \}</m>. Now show that <m>hk = kh</m> for <m>h \in P</m> and <m>k \in Q</m>. Deduce that <m>G = P \times Q</m> is abelian.</p>
