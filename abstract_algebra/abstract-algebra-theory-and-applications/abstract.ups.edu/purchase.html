<p>This text is free to download, but if you are doing more than just browsing, then purchasing a print copy is less expensive than printing it on a laser printer, less expensive than a single copy (unbound) at a copy shop, and very close to prices charged by copy shops when ordering multiple copies at a discount.  Before ordering, you might want to examine an <a href="download.html">evaluation copy</a>.</p>

<p>A nicely printed and bound (hardback) copy of the 2013 Edition of AATA can be purchased for under $20. It is available at your favorite online retailer or by special order from your local or college bookstore.  This is a service provided by <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~lmitchell2/index.html">Lon Mitchell</a> of Orthogonal Publishing.  The author, while supportive of this edition, is not involved directly in any way, including financially.  The ISBN for the 2013 Edition is:  978-0-9898975-0-1.</p>

<p>A note about editions: There have been some discrepancies in chapter numbering in earlier editions.  The orginal version contained a Chapter 0, now numbering begins with Chapter 1.  For the 2011 Edition, a chapter on normal subgroups and homomorphisms was split into two new chapters, affecting the numbering of later sections.  The numbering of chapters should be consistent beginning with the 2011 Edition.  The 2009 print version lacks some highlighted inline definitions.</p>
