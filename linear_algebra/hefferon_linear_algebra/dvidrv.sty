\ProvidesPackage{dvidrv}[2001/05/23 Set the DVI driver name (JH)]
% dvidrv.sty
%  LaTeX file to help set the name of the dvi driver from the command line.
%
% BACKGROUND
%   I want to use different dvi drivers on the same source file.
% Some packages (e.g., graphics) must be told who they are outputting 
% specials to.  Something like this. 
%    > latex ``\def\dvidrv{dvips}\input myfile''
% (tested under Linux with bash) means that myfile.tex can have calls 
% like \usepackage[\dvidrv]{graphics} or \usepackage[\dvidrv]{hyperref}.
%   This package gives \dvidrv a default definition, so you can have
% \usepackage calls as above, but still leave the \def\dvidrv off of
% the command line.
%
% USAGE
%  With this in your source file
%    \documentclass{article}
%    \usepackage{dvidrv}
% the package will:
%  (1) if the command line is 
%      > latex ``\def\dvidrv{dvipdfm}\input myfile''
%    then \dvidrv will expand to `dvipdfm'.
%  (3) if the command line is 
%      > latex myfile
%    then the package will try to grab the default dvi driver from 
%    the graphics package's color.cfg.  If there is no such file then
%    the default is set to `dvips'.
% Also possible is to get a per-document default.  Call the package as
%    \documentclass{article}
%    \usepackage[dvipsone]{dvidrv}
% in which case, absent (1) above we have
%  (2) the package will set \dvidrv to `dvipsone'.
