DESCRIPTION

In the lab.tex doc I put input for Sage in an environment.

\begin{sageoutput}
3*2
4*3
\end{sageoutput}

When LaTeX encounters that environment, it uses the definitions in 
sageoutput.sty.  

1) The commands are saved to a file named labnn.sagecmd where nn is the 
count of how many times this environment has appeared in the document 
so far: lab1.sagecmd, lab2.sagecmd ..

2) If there is an optional argument to the sageoutput environment
then it contains the edits to the output (see  below).  Any edit 
commands are saved to the file labnn.edit.

3) The process runs

  runsagelines.py sageoutput/labnn.sagecmd sageoutput/labnn.out 2> sageoutput/la
bnn.run.err; echo -n $? > sageoutput/labnn.runsagelines.rc

which feeds the Sage commands in labnn.sagecmd to Sage.  It collects the 
outputs in labnn.out.  Errors and the returned value are collected in the
other files for debugging.

4) Sometimes the output lines should be dropped (if they are setups carried
over from a prior sequence of commands) or are too long to fit on a line.
So in the optional argument I allow two kinds of commands.
  
  * d,1,2  will delete lines from line 1 up to but not including line 2 
  * s,2,3,4  will split line 2 at column 3 and pad the second half with 4
      spaces

Separate a sequence of these with semicolons: d,1,2;s,2,3,4 .

Note that if you delete line 1 then the new first line is numbered 2. That is,
you don't have to recount the lines for each command.

To effect this the sageoutput.sty will run 

  ./editsagelines.py sageoutput/labnn.out sageoutput/labnn.edit sageoutput/labnn.result 2> sageoutput/labnn.edit.err; echo -n $? > sageoutput/labnn.editsagelines.rc

which is similar to the above command.

5) The contents of labnn.result are included with
 
\lstinputlisting{sageoutput/labnn.result}


TIP

To run fresh graphics, remove the *.sagecmd files.
