\begin{para}A theorem will sometimes claim that some object, having some desirable property, is unique.  In other words, there should be only one such object.  To prove this, a standard technique is to assume there are two such objects and proceed to analyze the consequences.  The end result may be a contradiction (\acronymref{technique}{CD}), or the conclusion that the two allegedly different objects really are equal.\end{para}
