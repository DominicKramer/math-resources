Suppose $A$ is a square matrix.  Prove that there is a symmetric matrix $B$ and a skew-symmetric matrix $C$ such that $A=B+C$.  In other words, any square matrix can be decomposed into a symmetric matrix and a skew-symmetric matrix (\acronymref{technique}{DC}).  (Hint: consider building a proof on \acronymref{exercise}{MO.T34} and \acronymref{exercise}{MO.T35}.)
