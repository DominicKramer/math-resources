Suppose $S=\set{B_1,\,B_2,\,B_3,\,\ldots,\,B_p}$ is a set of matrices from $M_{mn}$.  Formulate appropriate definitions for the following terms and give an example of the use of each.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item A linear combination of elements of $S$.
\item A relation of linear dependence on $S$, both trivial and non-trivial.
\item $S$ is a linearly independent set.
\item $\spn{S}$.
\end{enumerate}
