Suppose $U$ and $V$ are vector spaces.  Define the function $\ltdefn{Z}{U}{V}$ by $\lt{T}{\vect{u}}=\zerovector_{V}$ for every $\vect{u}\in U$.  Then by \acronymref{exercise}{LT.M60}, $Z$ is a linear transformation.  Formulate a condition on $V$ that is equivalent to $Z$ being an surjective linear transformation.   In other words, fill in the blank to complete the following statement (and then give a proof):  $Z$ is surjective if and only if $V$ is \rule{1in}{1pt}. (See \acronymref{exercise}{ILT.M60}, \acronymref{exercise}{IVLT.M60}.)
