\acronymref{example}{SAR} concludes with an expression for a vector $\vect{u}\in\complex{5}$ that we believe will create the vector $\vect{v}\in\complex{5}$ when used to evaluate $T$.  That is, $\lt{T}{\vect{u}}=\vect{v}$.  Verify this assertion by actually evaluating $T$ with $\vect{u}$.  If you don't have the patience to push around all these symbols, try choosing a numerical instance of $\vect{v}$, compute $\vect{u}$, and then compute $\lt{T}{\vect{u}}$, which should result in $\vect{v}$.
