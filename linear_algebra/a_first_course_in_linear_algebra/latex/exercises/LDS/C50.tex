Consider the set of vectors from $\complex{3}$, $W$, given below.  Find a linearly independent set $T$ that contains three vectors from $W$ and such that $\spn{W}=\spn{T}$.

\begin{equation*}
W=
\set{\vect{v}_1,\,\vect{v}_2,\,\vect{v}_3,\,\vect{v}_4,\,\vect{v}_5}
=\set{
\colvector{2\\1\\1},\,
\colvector{-1\\-1\\1},\,
\colvector{1\\2\\3},\,
\colvector{3\\1\\3},\,
\colvector{0\\1\\-3}
}
\end{equation*}
