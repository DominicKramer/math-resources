Reprise \acronymref{example}{RES} by creating a new version of the vector $\vect{y}$.  In other words, form a new, different linear combination of the vectors in $R$ to create a new vector $\vect{y}$ (but do not simplify the problem too much by choosing any of the five new scalars to be zero).  Then express this new $\vect{y}$ as a combination of the vectors in $P$.
