Let $T$ be the set of vectors
$T=\set{
\colvector{1 \\ -1 \\ 2},\,
\colvector{3 \\ 0 \\ 1},\,
\colvector{4 \\ 2 \\ 3},\,
\colvector{3 \\ 0 \\ 6}
}$.
Find two different subsets of $T$, named $R$ and $S$, so that $R$ and $S$ each contain three vectors, and so that $\spn{R}=\spn{T}$ and $\spn{S}=\spn{T}$.  Prove that both $R$ and $S$ are linearly independent.
