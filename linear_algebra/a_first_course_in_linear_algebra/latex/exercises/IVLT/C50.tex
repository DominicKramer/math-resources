Consider the linear transformation $\ltdefn{S}{M_{12}}{P_1}$ from the set of $1\times 2$ matrices to the set of polynomials of degree at most 1, defined by 
%
\begin{equation*}
\lt{S}{\begin{bmatrix}a & b\end{bmatrix}}=(3a+b)+(5a+2b)x
\end{equation*}
%
Prove that $S$ is invertible.  Then show that the linear transformation
%
\begin{equation*}
\ltdefn{R}{P_1}{M_{12}},\quad \lt{R}{r+sx}=\begin{bmatrix}(2r-s) & (-5r+3s)\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
%
is the inverse of $S$, that is $\ltinverse{S}=R$.
