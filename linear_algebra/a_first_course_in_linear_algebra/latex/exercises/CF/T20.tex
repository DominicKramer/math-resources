\acronymref{theorem}{IP} constructs a unique polynomial through a set of $n+1$ points in the plane, $\setparts{(x_i,\,y_i)}{1\leq i\leq n+1}$, where the $x$-coordinates are all different.  Prove that the expression below is the same polynomial and include an explanation of the necessity of the hypothesis that the $x$-coordinates are all different.

\begin{align*}
p(x)&=
\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}
y_i \prod_{\substack{j=1\\j\neq i}}^{n+1}
\frac{x-x_j}{x_i-x_j}
\end{align*}

This is known as the Lagrange form of the interpolating polynomial.
