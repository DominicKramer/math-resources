\acronymref{theorem}{UMCOB} says that unitary matrices are characterized as those matrices that ``carry'' orthonormal bases to orthonormal bases.  This problem asks you to prove a similar result:  nonsingular matrices are characterized as those matrices that ``carry'' bases to bases.\par

More precisely, suppose that $A$ is a square matrix of size $n$ and $B=\set{\vectorlist{x}{n}}$ is a basis of $\complex{n}$.  Prove that $A$ is nonsingular if and only if $C=\set{A\vect{x}_1,\,A\vect{x}_2,\,A\vect{x}_3,\,\dots,\,A\vect{x}_n}$ is a basis of $\complex{n}$.
