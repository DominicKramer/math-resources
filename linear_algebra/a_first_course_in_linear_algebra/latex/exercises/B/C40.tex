From \acronymref{example}{RSB}, form an arbitrary (and nontrivial) linear combination of the four vectors in the original spanning set for $W$.  So the result of this computation is of course an element of $W$.  As such, this vector should be a linear combination of the basis vectors in $B$.  Find the (unique) scalars that provide this linear combination.  Repeat with another linear combination of the original four vectors.
