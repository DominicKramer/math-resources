For each archetype (\acronymref{appendix}{A}) that is a system of equations, do the following.  Form the augmented matrix that represents the system of equations.  Find the unique matrix $B$ in reduced row-echelon form guaranteed by \acronymref{theorem}{REMEF}, for the smaller archetypes compute by hand using the procedure in the proof, and  for the larger archetypes use a computational device (calculator, software).  You can check your work, since these matrices are listed for each archetype.  Then choose one solution of the original system of equations and verify that it is indeed a solution to the system represented by the matrix in reduced row-echelon form.  The relevant archetypes to explore are 
\acronymref{archetype}{A}, 
\acronymref{archetype}{B}, 
\acronymref{archetype}{C}, 
\acronymref{archetype}{D}, 
\acronymref{archetype}{E}, 
\acronymref{archetype}{F}, 
\acronymref{archetype}{G}, 
\acronymref{archetype}{H}, 
\acronymref{archetype}{I}, and
\acronymref{archetype}{J}.
