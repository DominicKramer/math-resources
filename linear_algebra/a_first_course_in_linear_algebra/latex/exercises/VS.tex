\begin{para}The next three problems suggest that under the right situations we can ``cancel.''  In practice, these techniques should be avoided in other proofs.  Prove each of the following statements.\end{para}
%
\exercise{T21}{\robertbeezer}     % Cancel in addition
\exercise{T22}{\robertbeezer}     % Cancel scalars in scalar multiplication
\exercise{T23}{\robertbeezer}     % Cancel vectors in scalar multiplication
\exercise{T30}{\robertbeezer}     % Property O is just for 1
