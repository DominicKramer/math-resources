Suppose $U$ and $V$ are vector spaces and define a function $\ltdefn{Z}{U}{V}$ by $\lt{T}{\vect{u}}=\zerovector_{V}$ for every $\vect{u}\in U$.  Prove that $Z$ is a (stupid) linear transformation.  (See \acronymref{exercise}{ILT.M60}, \acronymref{exercise}{SLT.M60}, \acronymref{exercise}{IVLT.M60}.)
