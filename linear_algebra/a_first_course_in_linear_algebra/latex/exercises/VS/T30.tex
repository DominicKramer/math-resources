Suppose that $V$ is a vector space and $\alpha\in\complexes$ is a scalar such that $\alpha\vect{x}=\vect{x}$ for every $\vect{x}\in V$.  Prove that $\alpha = 1$.  In other words, \acronymref{property}{O} is not duplicated for any other scalar but the ``special'' scalar, 1.  (This question was suggested by James Gallagher.)
