The characteristic polynomial of the square matrix $A$ is usually defined as $r_A(x)=\detname{xI_n-A}$.  Find a specific relationship between our characteristic polynomial, $\charpoly{A}{x}$, and $r_A(x)$, give a proof of your relationship, and use this to explain why \acronymref{theorem}{EMRCP} can remain essentially unchanged with either definition.  Explain the advantages of each definition over the other.  (Computing with both definitions, for a $2\times 2$ and a $3\times 3$ matrix, might be a good way to start.)
