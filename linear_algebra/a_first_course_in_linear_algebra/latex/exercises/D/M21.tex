A $2\times 2$ matrix $B$ is upper triangular if $\matrixentry{B}{21}=0$.  Let $UT_2$ be the set of all $2\times 2$ upper triangular matrices.  Then $UT_2$ is a subspace of the vector space of all $2\times 2$ matrices, $M_{22}$ (you may assume this).  Determine the dimension of $UT_2$ providing {\em all} of the necessary justifications for your answer.
