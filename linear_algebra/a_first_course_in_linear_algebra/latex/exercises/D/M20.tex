$M_{22}$ is the vector space of $2\times 2$ matrices.  Let $S_{22}$ denote the set of all $2\times 2$ symmetric matrices.  That is  
%
\begin{equation*}
S_{22}=\setparts{A\in M_{22}}{\transpose{A}=A}
\end{equation*}
%
(a)\quad Show that $S_{22}$ is a subspace of $M_{22}$.\\
(b)\quad Exhibit a basis for $S_{22}$ and prove that it has the required properties.\\
(c)\quad What is the dimension of $S_{22}$?
