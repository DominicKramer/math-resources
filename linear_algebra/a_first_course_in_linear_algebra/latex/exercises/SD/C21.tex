Determine if the matrix $A$ below is diagonalizable.  If the matrix is diagonalizable, then find a diagonal matrix $D$ that is similar to $A$, and provide the invertible matrix $S$ that performs the similarity transformation.  You should use your calculator to find the eigenvalues of the matrix, but try only using the row-reducing function of your calculator to assist with finding eigenvectors.

A=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 9 & 9 & 24 \\
 -3 & -27 & -29 & -68 \\
 1 & 11 & 13 & 26 \\
 1 & 7 & 7 & 18
\end{bmatrix}
