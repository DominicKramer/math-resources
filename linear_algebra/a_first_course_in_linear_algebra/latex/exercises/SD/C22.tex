Consider the matrix $A$ below.  Find the eigenvalues of $A$ using a calculator and use these to construct the characteristic polynomial of $A$, $\charpoly{A}{x}$.  State the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue. Find all of the eigenspaces for $A$ by computing expressions for null spaces, only using your calculator to row-reduce matrices.  State the geometric multiplicity of each eigenvalue.  Is $A$ diagonalizable?  If not, explain why.  If so, find a diagonal matrix $D$ that is similar to $A$.

\begin{equation*}
A=
\begin{bmatrix}
 19 & 25 & 30 & 5 \\
 -23 & -30 & -35 & -5 \\
 7 & 9 & 10 & 1 \\
 -3 & -4 & -5 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
