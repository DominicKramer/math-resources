\acronymref{example}{CSOCD} expresses the column space of the coefficient matrix from \acronymref{archetype}{D} (call the matrix $A$ here) as the span of the first two columns of $A$.  In \acronymref{example}{CSMCS} we determined that the vector
%
\begin{equation*}
\vect{c}=\colvector{2\\3\\2}
\end{equation*}
%
{\em was not} in the column space of $A$  and that the vector 
%
\begin{equation*}
\vect{b}=\colvector{8\\-12\\4}
\end{equation*}
%
{\em was} in the column space of $A$.   Attempt to write $\vect{c}$ and $\vect{b}$ as linear combinations of the two vectors in the span construction for the column space in \acronymref{example}{CSOCD} and record your observations.
