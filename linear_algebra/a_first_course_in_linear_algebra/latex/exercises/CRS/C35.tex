For the matrix $A$ below, find two different linearly independent sets whose spans equal the column space of $A$, $\csp{A}$, such that\\
(a)\quad the elements are each columns of $A$.\\
(b)\quad the set is obtained by a procedure that is substantially different from the procedure you use in part (a).

\begin{align*}
A&=
\begin{bmatrix}
 3 & 5 & 1 & -2 \\
 1 & 2 & 3 & 3 \\
 -3 & -4 & 7 & 13
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
