For the matrix $A$ below find a set of vectors $T$ meeting the following requirements:  (1) the span of $T$ is the column space of $A$, that is, $\spn{T}=\csp{A}$, (2) $T$ is linearly independent, and (3) the elements of $T$ are columns of $A$.

\begin{equation*}
A=
\begin{bmatrix}
 2 & 1 & 4 & -1 & 2 \\
 1 & -1 & 5 & 1 & 1 \\
 -1 & 2 & -7 & 0 & 1 \\
 2 & -1 & 8 & -1 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
