Suppose that we are checking if a square matrix of size $n$ is unitary.  Show that a straightforward application of \acronymref{theorem}{CUMOS} requires the computation of $n^2$ inner products when the matrix is unitary, and fewer when the matrix is not orthogonal.  Then show that this maximum number of inner products can be reduced to $\frac{1}{2}n(n+1)$ in light of \acronymref{theorem}{IPAC}.
