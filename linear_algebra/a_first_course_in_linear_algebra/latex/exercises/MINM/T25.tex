The notation $A^k$ means a repeated matrix product between $k$ copies of the square matrix $A$.\\
(a)\quad Assume $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix where $A^2=\zeromatrix$ (which does not imply that $A=\zeromatrix$.)  Prove that $I_n-A$ is invertible by showing that $I_n+A$ is an inverse of $I_n-A$.\\
(b)\quad Assume that $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix where $A^3=\zeromatrix$.  Prove that $I_n-A$ is invertible.\\
(c)\quad Form a general theorem based on your observations from parts (a) and (b) and provide a proof.
