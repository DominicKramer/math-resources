Prove the following variant of \acronymref{theorem}{EMMVP} that has a weaker hypothesis:  Suppose that $C=\set{\vectorlist{u}{p}}$ is a linearly independent spanning set for $\complex{n}$.  Suppose also that $A$ and $B$ are $m\times n$ matrices such that $A\vect{u}_i=B\vect{u}_i$ for every $1\leq i\leq n$.  Then $A=B$.\par

Can you weaken the hypothesis even further while still preserving the conclusion?
