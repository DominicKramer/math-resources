Provide an alternative for the second half of the proof of \acronymref{theorem}{NMUS}, without appealing to properties of the reduced row-echelon form of the coefficient matrix.  In other words, prove that if $A$ is nonsingular, then $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ has a unique solution for every choice of the constant vector $\vect{b}$.  Construct this proof without using \acronymref{theorem}{REMEF} or \acronymref{theorem}{RREFU}.
