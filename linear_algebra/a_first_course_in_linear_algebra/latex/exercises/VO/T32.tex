Review the definition of vector subtraction in \acronymref{exercise}{VO.T30}.  Prove that vector subtraction obeys a distributive property.  Specifically, prove that $\alpha\left(\vect{u}-\vect{v}\right)=\alpha\vect{u}-\alpha\vect{v}$.\par

Can you give two different proofs? Base one on the definition given in \acronymref{exercise}{VO.T30} and base the other on the equivalent formulation proved in \acronymref{exercise}{VO.T30}.
