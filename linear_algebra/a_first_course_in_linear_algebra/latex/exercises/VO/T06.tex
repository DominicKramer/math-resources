Provide reasons (mostly vector space properties) as justification for each of the six steps of the following proof.\par
%
{\bf Theorem}
For any vector $\vect{u}\in\complex{m}$, $0\vect{u}=\zerovector.$\par
%
{\bf Proof}: Let $\vect{u}\in\complex{m}$.\par
%
\begin{align*}
\zerovector
&= 0\vect{u} +(-0\vect{u})\\
&= (0+0)\vect{u} + (-0\vect{u})\\
&= (0\vect{u}+0\vect{u}) + (-0\vect{u})\\
&= 0\vect{u} + (0\vect{u} + (-0\vect{u}))\\
&= 0\vect{u} + \zerovector\\
&= 0\vect{u}
\end{align*}
