Provide reasons (mostly vector space properties) as justification for each of the seven steps of the following proof.\par

{\bf Theorem}
For any vectors $\vect{u},\,\vect{v},\,\vect{w}\in\complex{m}$,
if $\vect{u} + \vect{v} = \vect{u} + \vect{w}$, then $\vect{v} = \vect{w}$.\par
%
{\bf Proof}: Let $\vect{u},\,\vect{v},\,\vect{w}\in\complex{m}$,
and suppose $\vect{u} + \vect{v} = \vect{u} + \vect{w}$.
%
\begin{align*}
\vect{v}
&= \zerovector + \vect{v}\\
&= (-\vect{u} + \vect{u}) + \vect{v}\\
&= -\vect{u} + (\vect{u} + \vect{v})\\
&= -\vect{u} + (\vect{u} + \vect{w})\\
&= (-\vect{u} + \vect{u}) + \vect{w}\\
&= \zerovector + \vect{w}\\
&= \vect{w}
\end{align*}
