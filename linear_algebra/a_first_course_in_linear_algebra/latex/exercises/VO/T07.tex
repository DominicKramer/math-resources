Provide reasons (mostly vector space properties) as justification for each of the six steps of the following proof.\par
%
{\bf Theorem} 
For any scalar $c$,  $c\,\zerovector = \zerovector$.\par
%
{\bf Proof}: Let $c$ be an arbitrary scalar.\par
%
\begin{align*}
\zerovector
&= c\zerovector + (-c\zerovector)\\
&= c(\zerovector + \zerovector) + (-c\zerovector)\\
&= (c\zerovector + c\zerovector) + (-c\zerovector)\\
&= c\zerovector + (c\zerovector + (-c\zerovector))\\
&= c\zerovector + \zerovector\\
&= c\zerovector
\end{align*}
