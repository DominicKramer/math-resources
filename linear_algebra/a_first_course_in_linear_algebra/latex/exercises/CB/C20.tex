In \acronymref{example}{CBCV} we computed the vector representation of $\vect{y}$ relative to $C$, $\vectrep{C}{\vect{y}}$, as an example of \acronymref{theorem}{CB}.  Compute this same representation directly.  In other words, apply \acronymref{definition}{VR} rather than \acronymref{theorem}{CB}.
