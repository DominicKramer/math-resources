In \acronymref{example}{TMP} the first table lists the cost (per kilogram) to manufacture each of the three varieties of trail mix (bulk, standard, fancy).  For example, it costs \$3.69 to make one kilogram of the bulk variety.  Re-compute each of these three costs and notice that the computations are linear in character.
