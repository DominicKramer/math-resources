In \acronymref{example}{TMP} two different prices were considered for marketing standard mix with the revised recipes (one-third peanuts in each recipe).  Selling standard mix at \$5.50 resulted in selling the minimum amount of the fancy mix and no bulk mix.  At \$5.25 it was best for profits to sell the maximum amount of fancy mix and then sell no standard mix.  Determine a selling price for standard mix that allows for maximum profits while still selling some of each type of mix.
