Suppose that the set $S$ in the hypothesis of \acronymref{theorem}{GSP} is not just linearly independent, but is also orthogonal.  Prove that the set $T$ created by the Gram-Schmidt procedure is equal to $S$.  (Note that we are getting a stronger conclusion than $\spn{T}=\spn{S}$ --- the conclusion is that $T=S$.)  In other words, it is pointless to apply the Gram-Schmidt procedure to a set that is already orthogonal.
