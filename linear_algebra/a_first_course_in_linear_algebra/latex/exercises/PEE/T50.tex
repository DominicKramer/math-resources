\acronymref{theorem}{EIM} says that if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the nonsingular matrix $A$, then $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ is an eigenvalue of $\inverse{A}$.  Write an alternate proof of this theorem using the characteristic polynomial and without making reference to an eigenvector of $A$ for $\lambda$.
