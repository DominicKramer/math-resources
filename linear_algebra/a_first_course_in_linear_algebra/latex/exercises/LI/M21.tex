Suppose that $S=\set{\vect{v}_1,\,\vect{v}_2,\,\vect{v}_3}$ is a linearly independent set of three vectors from $\complex{873}$.  Prove that the set
%
\begin{align*}
T&=
\set{
2\vect{v}_1+3\vect{v}_2+\vect{v}_3,\,
\vect{v}_1-\vect{v}_2+2\vect{v}_3,\,
2\vect{v}_1+\vect{v}_2-\vect{v}_3
}
\end{align*}
%
is linearly independent.
