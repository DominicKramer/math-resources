Suppose that $\set{\vect{v}_1,\,\vect{v}_2,\,\vect{v}_3,\,\vect{v}_4}$ is a linearly independent set in $\complex{35}$.  Prove that 
%
\begin{equation*}
\set{
\vect{v}_1,\,
\vect{v}_1+\vect{v}_2,\,
\vect{v}_1+\vect{v}_2+\vect{v}_3,\,
\vect{v}_1+\vect{v}_2+\vect{v}_3+\vect{v}_4
}
\end{equation*}
%
is a linearly independent set.
