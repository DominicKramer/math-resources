Consider the subspace
$W=\spn{\set{\vect{v}_1,\,\vect{v}_2,\,\vect{v}_3,\,\vect{v}_4}}$.
Find a set $S$ so that (1)  $S$ is a subset of $W$, (2) $S$ is linearly independent, and (3) $W=\spn{S}$.  Write each vector not included in $S$ as a linear combination of the vectors that are in $S$.
%
\begin{align*}
\vect{v}_1&=\colvector{1\\-1\\2}
&
\vect{v}_2&=\colvector{4\\-4\\8}
&
\vect{v}_3&=\colvector{-3\\2\\-7}
&
\vect{v}_4&=\colvector{2\\1\\7}
\end{align*}
