where $t^2$ is consistently replaced by $2t+1$ in any intermediate results obtained with polynomial multiplication.  Compute the first nine powers of $t$ ($t^0$ through $t^8$).  Use this information to aid you in the construction of the multiplication table for this field.  What is the multiplicative inverse of $2t$?
