Construct a finite field with 25 elements using the set
%
\begin{align*}
F&=\setparts{a+bt}{a,\,b\in\Z_5}
\end{align*}
%
where $t^2$ is consistently replaced by $t+3$ in any intermediate results obtained with polynomial multiplication.  Compute the first 25 powers of $t$ ($t^0$ through $t^{24}$).  Use this information to aid you in computing in this field.  What is the multiplicative inverse of $2t$?  What is the multiplicative inverse of $4$?  What is the multiplicative inverse of $1+4t$?\par

Find a basis for $F$ as a vector space with $\Z_5$ used as the set of scalars.
