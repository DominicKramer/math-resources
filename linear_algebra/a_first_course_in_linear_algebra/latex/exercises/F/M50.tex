Construct a finite field with 16 elements using the set
%
\begin{align*}
F&=\setparts{a+bt+ct^2+dt^3}{a,\,b,\,c,\,d\in\Z_2}
\end{align*}
%
where $t^4$ is consistently replaced by $t+1$ in any intermediate results obtained with polynomial multiplication.  Compute the first 16 powers of $t$ ($t^0$ through $t^{15}$).    Consider the set $G=\set{0,\,1,\,t^5,\,t^{10}}$.  Then $G$ will also be a finite field, a subfield of $F$.  Construct the addition and multiplication tables for $G$.  Notice that since both $G$ and $F$ are vector spaces over $\Z_2$, and $G\subseteq F$, by \acronymref{definition}{S}, $G$ is a subspace of $F$.
