At the end of \acronymref{example}{VFS}, the vector $\vect{w}$ is claimed to be a solution to the linear system under discussion.  Verify that $\vect{w}$ really is a solution.  Then determine the four scalars that express $\vect{w}$ as a linear combination of $\vect{c}$, $\vect{u}_1$, $\vect{u}_2$, $\vect{u}_3$.
