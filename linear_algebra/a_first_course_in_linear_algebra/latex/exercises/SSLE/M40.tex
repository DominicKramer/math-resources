Solutions to the system in \acronymref{example}{IS} are given as
%
\begin{equation*}
(x_1,\,x_2,\,x_3,\,x_4)=(-1-2a+3b,\,4+a-2b,\,a,\,b)
\end{equation*}
%
Evaluate the three equations of the original system with these expressions in  $a$ and $b$ and verify that each equation is true, no matter what values are chosen for $a$ and $b$.
