Suppose that $A$ is a square matrix and there is a vector, $\vect{b}$, such that $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ has a unique solution.  Prove that $A$ is nonsingular.  Give a direct proof (perhaps appealing to \acronymref{theorem}{PSPHS}) rather than just negating a sentence from the text discussing a similar situation.
