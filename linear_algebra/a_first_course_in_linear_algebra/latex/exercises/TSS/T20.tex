Suppose that $B$ is a matrix in reduced row-echelon form that is equivalent to the augmented matrix of a system of equations with $m$ equations in $n$ variables.  Let $r$, $D$ and $F$ be as defined in \acronymref{notation}{RREFA}.  Prove that $d_k\geq k$ for all $1\leq k\leq r$.  Then suppose that $r\geq 2$ and $1\leq k <\ell\leq r$ and determine what can you conclude, in general, about the following entries.
%
\begin{align*}
\matrixentry{B}{k,d_k}&
&
\matrixentry{B}{k,d_\ell}&
&
\matrixentry{B}{\ell,d_k}&
&
\matrixentry{B}{d_k,k}&
&
\matrixentry{B}{d_k,\ell}&
&
\matrixentry{B}{d_\ell,k}&
&
\matrixentry{B}{d_k,f_\ell}&
&
\matrixentry{B}{d_\ell,f_k}&
\end{align*}

If you cannot conclude anything about an entry, then say so.  (See \acronymref{exercise}{TSS.M46} and \acronymref{exercise}{TSS.M70}.)
