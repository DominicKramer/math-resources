Part of \acronymref{exercise}{B.T50} is the half of the proof where we assume the matrix $A$ is nonsingular and prove that a set is basis.  In \acronymref{solution}{B.T50} we proved directly that the set was both linearly independent and a spanning set.  Shorten this part of the proof by applying \acronymref{theorem}{G}.  Be careful, there is one subtlety.
