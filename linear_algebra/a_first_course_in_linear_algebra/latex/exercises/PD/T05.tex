Trivially, if $U$ and $V$ are two subspaces of $W$, then $\dimension{U}=\dimension{V}$.  Combine this fact, \acronymref{theorem}{PSSD}, and \acronymref{theorem}{EDYES} all into one grand combined theorem.  You might look to \acronymref{theorem}{PIP} stylistic inspiration.  (Notice this problem does not ask you to prove anything.  It just asks you to roll up three theorems into one compact, logically equivalent statement.)
