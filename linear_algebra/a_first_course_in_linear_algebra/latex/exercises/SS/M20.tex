In \acronymref{example}{SCAD} we began with the four columns of the coefficient matrix of \acronymref{archetype}{D}, and used these columns in a span construction.  Then we methodically argued that we could remove the last column, then the third column, and create the same set by just doing a span construction with the first two columns.  We claimed we could not go any further, and had removed as many vectors as possible.  Provide a convincing argument for why a third vector cannot be removed.
