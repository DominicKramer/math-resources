In the spirit of \acronymref{example}{SCAD}, begin with the four columns of the coefficient matrix of \acronymref{archetype}{C}, and use these columns in a span construction to build the set $S$.  Argue that $S$ can be expressed as the span of just three of the columns of the coefficient matrix (saying exactly which three) and in the spirit of \acronymref{exercise}{SS.M20} argue that no one of these three vectors can be removed and still have a span construction create $S$.
