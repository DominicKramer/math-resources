Suppose \computerfont{A} is the name of a matrix stored in the TI-86.  
Use the command $\computerfont{A^T}$ to transpose \computerfont{A}.  This command can be found by 
pressing the \computerfont{MATRX} key, then \computerfont{F3} for \computerfont{MATH}, then \computerfont{F2} for $\computerfont{^T}$.
