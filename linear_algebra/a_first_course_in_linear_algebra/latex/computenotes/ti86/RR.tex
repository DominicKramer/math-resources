If \computerfont{A} is the name of a matrix stored in the TI-86, then the command \computerfont{rref A} will return the reduced row-echelon form of the matrix.  This command can also be found by pressing the \computerfont{MATRX} key, then \computerfont{F4} for \computerfont{OPS}, and finally, \computerfont{F5} for \computerfont{rref}.\par

Note that this command will not work for a matrix with more rows than columns.  (Ed. Not sure just why this is!)  A work-around is to pad the matrix with extra columns of zeros until the matrix is square.
