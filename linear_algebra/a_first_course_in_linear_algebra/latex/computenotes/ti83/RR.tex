Suppose \computerfont{B} is the name of a matrix stored in the TI-83.  Press the \computerfont{MATRX} key.  Press the right arrow key once so that \computerfont{MATH} is highlighted.  Press the down arrow eleven times so that \computerfont{rref (} is highlighted, then press \computerfont{ENTER}.  to choose the matrix \computerfont{B}, press \computerfont{MATRX}, then the down arrow once followed by \computerfont{ENTER}.  Supply a right parenthesis (\computerfont{)}) and press \computerfont{ENTER}.\par

Note that this command will not work for a matrix with more rows than columns.  (Ed. Not sure just why this is!)  A work-around is to pad the matrix with extra columns of zeros until the matrix is square.
