{\sl SAGE} can solve a variety of systems of equations with the \computerfont{solve( )} command, even when the equations are not linear (see \acronymref{exercise}{SSLE.M70}).  But we can afford to specialize here to just linear systems.  First, you must specify your variables in advance, so for example,  \computerfont{var('x1,x2,x3')}  might precede a system with three equations.  Equations are then written just as you might expect, except that equality is written as \computerfont{==}, since computer programs have traditionally reserved \computerfont{=} to assign values to variables.  And remember to use a \computerfont{*} to indicate that a coefficient multiplies a variable.\par
%
The example below illustrates the use of the command and the possibilities for results.  Each system would be preceded by establishing the variables with the command \computerfont{var('x,y')}.  In the case of an infinite solution set, free variables are denoted as \computerfont{rx} where \computerfont{x} is an integer that increases throughout a session.  The style of this description of a solution set is reminiscent of the style we used in \acronymref{chapter}{SLE} before we were accustomed to using linear combinations of vectors (\acronymref{theorem}{VFSLS}).
