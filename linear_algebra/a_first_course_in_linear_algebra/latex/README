FCLA LaTeX directory (2012/10/14)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These files comprise updates to Version 2.99 of the text, with the source in LaTeX format.  They are OBSOLETE with their conversion to XML as part of improvements for Version 3.00.  They remain here only for informative purposes.

If you rollback to Version 2.99, then they should compile with pdflatex.  The current state contains LaTeX environments to support the conversion to XML, but which are not implemented in the style files.  They might be trivial to implement, but no attempt has been made to do this.
