The augmented matrix for the given linear system and its row-reduced form are:
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 & -1 & 3\\
1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
\rref
\begin{bmatrix}
\leading{1} & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0\\
0 & \leading{1} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0  & 0 & 0 & \leading{1} 
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
For this system, we have $n = 4$ and $r = 3$.  However, with a leading 1 in the last column we see that the original system has no solution by \acronymref{theorem}{RCLS}.
