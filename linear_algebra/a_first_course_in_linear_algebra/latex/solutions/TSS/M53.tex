The system could be inconsistent.  If it is consistent, then because it has more variables than equations \acronymref{theorem}{CMVEI} implies that there would be infinitely many solutions.  So, of all the possibilities in \acronymref{theorem}{PSSLS}, only the case of a unique solution can be ruled out.
