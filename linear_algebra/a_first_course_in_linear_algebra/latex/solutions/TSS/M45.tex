Demonstrate that the system is consistent by verifying any one of the four sample solutions provided.  Then because $n=9>6=m$, \acronymref{theorem}{CMVEI} gives us the conclusion that the system has infinitely many solutions.  Notice that we only know the system will have \emph{at least} $9-6=3$ free variables, but very well could have more.  We do not know know that $r=6$, only that $r\leq 6$.
