The matrix $E$ has no inverse, though we do not yet have a theorem that allows us to reach this conclusion.  However, when row-reducing the matrix $\augmented{E}{I_5}$, the first 5 columns will not row-reduce to the $5\times 5$ identity matrix, so we are a t a loss on how we might compute the inverse.  When requesting that your calculator compute $\inverse{E}$, it should give some indication that $E$ does not have an inverse.
