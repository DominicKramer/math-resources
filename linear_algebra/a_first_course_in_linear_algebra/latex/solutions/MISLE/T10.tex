For a large collection of small examples, let $D$ be any $2\times 2$ matrix that has an inverse (\acronymref{theorem}{TTMI} can help you construct such a matrix, $I_2$ is a simple choice).  Set $A=D$ and $B=(-1)D$.  While $\inverse{A}$ and $\inverse{B}$ both exist, what is $\inverse{\left(A+B\right)}$?\par

For a large collection of examples of any size, consider $A=B=I_n$.  Can the proposed statement be salvaged to become a theorem?
