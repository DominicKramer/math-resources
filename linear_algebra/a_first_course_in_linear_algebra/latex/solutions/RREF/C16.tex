The augmented matrix of the system of equations is
%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
 2 & 3 & 19 & -4 & 2 \\
 1 & 2 & 12 & -3 & 1 \\
 -1 & 2 & 8 & -5 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
%
which row-reduces to
%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
 \leading{1} & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & \leading{1} & 5 & -2 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \leading{1}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Row 3 represents the equation $0=1$, which is patently false, so the original system has no solutions.  We can express the solution set as the empty set, $\emptyset=\set{\relax}$.
