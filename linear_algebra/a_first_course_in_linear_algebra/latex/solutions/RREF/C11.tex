The augmented matrix row-reduces to\\

\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
\leading{1} &  0 &  1 &  4/5 &  0\\
0 &  \leading{1} &  -1 &  -1/10 &  0\\ 
0 &  0 &  0 &  0 &  \leading{1}
\end{bmatrix}

Row 3 represents the equation $0=1$, which is patently false, so the original system has no solutions.  We can express the solution set as the empty set, $\emptyset=\set{\relax}$.
