Let $l, m, p$ denote the number of lizards, mice and peacocks.  Then the statements from the problem yield the equations:
%
\begin{align*}
4l+4m+2p&=108\\
l+m+p &= 30\\
2l-m&=0
\end{align*}
%
We form the augmented matrix for this system and row-reduce
%
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 4 & 2 & 108\\
1 & 1 & 1 & 30\\
2 & -1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
&\rref
\begin{bmatrix}
\leading{1} & 0 & 0 &  8\\
0 & \leading{1} & 0 &  16\\
0 & 0 & \leading{1} &  6
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
%
From the row-reduced matrix, we see that we have an equivalent system $l=8$, $m=16$, and $p=6$, which means that you have 8 lizards, 16 mice and 6 peacocks.
