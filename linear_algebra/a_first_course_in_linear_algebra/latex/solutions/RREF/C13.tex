The augmented matrix of the system of equations is
%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 8 & -7 & -2\\ 
3 & 2 & 12 & -5 & 6\\ 
-1 & 1 & 1 & -5 & -10
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
%
which row-reduces to
%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
\leading{1} & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0\\ 
0 & \leading{1} & 3 & -4 & 0\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \leading{1}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Row 3 represents the equation $0=1$, which is patently false, so the original system has no solutions.  We can express the solution set as the empty set, $\emptyset=\set{\relax}$.
