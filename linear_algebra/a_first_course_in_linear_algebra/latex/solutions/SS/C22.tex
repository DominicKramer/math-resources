The vector form of the solutions obtained in this manner will involve precisely the vectors described in \acronymref{theorem}{SSNS} as providing the null space of the coefficient matrix of the system as a span.  These vectors occur in each archetype in a description of the null space.  Studying \acronymref{example}{VFSAL} may be of some help.
