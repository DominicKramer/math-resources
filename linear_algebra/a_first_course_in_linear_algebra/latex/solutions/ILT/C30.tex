We can see without computing that $T$ is not injective, since the degree of $M_{2,2}$ is larger than the degree of $P_2$.  However, that doesn't address the question of the kernel of $T$.  We need to find all matrices $\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$ so that $(a + b) + (a + c)x + (a + d)x^2 = 0$.  This means $a + b = 0$, $a + c = 0$, and $a + d = 0$, or equivalently, $b = d = c = -a$.  Thus, the kernel is a one-dimensional subspace of $M_{2,2}$ spanned by $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1\\-1&-1 \end{bmatrix}$.  Symbolically, we have $\krn{T} = \spn{\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1\\-1&-1 \end{bmatrix}}$.
