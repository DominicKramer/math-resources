Solutions for \acronymref{archetype}{D} and \acronymref{archetype}{I} are described carefully in \acronymref{example}{VFSAD} and \acronymref{example}{VFSAI}.  The technique described in these examples is probably more useful than carefully deciphering the notation of \acronymref{theorem}{VFSLS}.  The solution for each archetype is contained in its description.  So now you can check-off the box for that item.
