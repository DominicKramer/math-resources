\acronymref{theorem}{NMRRI} tells us that the coefficient matrix will not row-reduce to the identity matrix.  So if we were to row-reduce the augmented matrix of this system of equations, we would not get a unique solution.  So by \acronymref{theorem}{PSSLS} the remaining possibilities are no solutions, or infinitely many.
