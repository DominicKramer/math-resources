Since $A$ and $B$ are row-equivalent matrices, consideration of the three row operations (\acronymref{definition}{RO}) will show that the augmented matrices, $\augmented{A}{\zerovector}$ and $\augmented{B}{\zerovector}$, are also row-equivalent matrices.  This says that the two homogeneous systems, $\homosystem{A}$ and $\homosystem{B}$ are equivalent systems.  $\homosystem{A}$ has only the zero vector as a solution (\acronymref{definition}{NM}), thus $\homosystem{B}$ has only the zero vector as a solution.  Finally, by \acronymref{definition}{NM}, we see that $B$ is nonsingular.\par

Form a similar theorem replacing ``nonsingular'' by ``singular'' in both the hypothesis and the conclusion. Prove this new theorem with an approach just like the one above, and/or employ the result about nonsingular matrices in a proof by contradiction.
