Since we are given that the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $\charpoly{A}{x} = (4-x)(1-x)^2$, we see that the eigenvalues are 
$\lambda = 4$ with algebraic multiplicity $\algmult{A}{4} = 1$ and 
$\lambda = 1$ with algebraic multiplicity $\algmult{A}{1} = 2$.   
The corresponding eigenspaces are 
%
\begin{align*}
\eigenspace{A}{4} &= \spn{\colvector{1\\1\\1}}
&
\eigenspace{A}{1} &= \spn{\colvector{1\\-1\\0},\colvector{1\\0\\-1}}
\end{align*}
