According to \acronymref{theorem}{SLTD}, if a linear transformation $\ltdefn{T}{U}{V}$ is surjective, then $\dimension{U}\ge\dimension{V}$.  In this example, $U = P_3$ has dimension 4, and $V = \complex{5}$ has dimension 5, so $T$ cannot be surjective.  (There is no way $T$ can ``expand'' the domain $P_3$ to fill the codomain $\complex{5}$.)
