There is something to notice here that will make our job much easier:  Since each of these sets are comprised of $3\times 3$ matrices with the standard operations of addition and scalar multiplication of matrices, the last 8 properties will automatically hold.  That is, we really only need to verify \acronymref{property}{AC} and \acronymref{property}{SC}.
\begin{itemize}
%
\item[a). ]  
This set is not closed under either scalar multiplication or addition (fails \acronymref{property}{AC} and \acronymref{property}{SC}).  For example, 
$3\begin{bmatrix} *&*&1\\ *&1&*\\ 1&*&*\end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} *&*&3\\ *&3&*\\ 3&*&*\end{bmatrix}$ 
is not a member of the proposed set.
%
\item[b). ]  
This set is closed under both scalar multiplication and addition, so this set is a vector space with the standard operation of addition and scalar multiplication.
%
\item[c). ]  
This set is closed under both scalar multiplication and addition, so this set is a vector space with the standard operation of addition and scalar multiplication.
%
\item[d). ]  
This set is closed under both scalar multiplication and addition, so this set is a vector space with the standard operation of addition and scalar multiplication.
%
\end{itemize}
