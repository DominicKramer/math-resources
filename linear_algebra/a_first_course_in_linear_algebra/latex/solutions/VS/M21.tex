Additive closure will hold, but scalar closure will not.  The best way to convince yourself of this is to construct a counterexample.  Such as, $\frac{1}{2}\in\complexes$ and $\colvector{1\\0}\in\Z^2$, however $\frac{1}{2}\colvector{1\\0}=\colvector{\frac{1}{2}\\0}\not\in\Z^2$, which violates \acronymref{property}{SC}.  So $\Z^2$ is not a vector space.
