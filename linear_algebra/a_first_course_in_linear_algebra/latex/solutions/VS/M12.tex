Let's consider the existence of a zero vector, as required by \acronymref{property}{Z} of a vector space.  The ``regular'' zero vector fails : $\colvector{x\\y}+\colvector{0\\0} = \colvector{y\\x}\ne\colvector{x\\y}$ (remember that the property must hold for {\it{every}} vector, not just for some).  Is there another vector that fills the role of the zero vector?  Suppose that $\zerovector=\colvector{z_1\\z_2}$.  Then for any vector $\colvector{x\\y}$, we have
%
\begin{align*}
\colvector{x\\y}+\colvector{z_1 \\z_2}
&= \colvector{y + z_2\\x + z_1} 
=  \colvector{x\\y}
\end{align*}
%
so that $x = y + z_2$ and $y = x + z_1$.  This means that $z_1 = y - x$ and $z_2 = x - y$.  However, since $x$ and $y$ can be any complex numbers, there are no fixed complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$ that satisfy these equations.  Thus, there is no zero vector, \acronymref{property}{Z}  is not valid, and the set  $\complex{2}$ with the proposed operations is not a vector space.
