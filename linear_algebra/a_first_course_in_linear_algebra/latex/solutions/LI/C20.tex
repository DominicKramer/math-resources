With three vectors from $\complex{3}$, we can form a square matrix by making these three vectors the columns of a matrix.  We do so, and row-reduce to obtain,
%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
\leading{1} & 0 & 0\\
0 & \leading{1} & 0\\ 
0 & 0 & \leading{1}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

the $3\times 3$ identity matrix.  So by \acronymref{theorem}{NME2} the original matrix is nonsingular and its columns are therefore a linearly independent set.
