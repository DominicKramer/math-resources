\acronymref{theorem}{LIVRN} says we can answer this question by putting theses vectors into a matrix as columns and row-reducing.  Doing this we obtain,
%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
\leading{1} & 0 & 0\\
0 & \leading{1} & 0\\ 
0 & 0 & \leading{1}\\ 
0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
%
With $n=3$ (3 vectors, 3 columns) and $r=3$ (3 leading 1's) we have $n=r$ and the theorem says the vectors are linearly independent.
