Since the system is homogeneous, we know it has the trivial solution (\acronymref{theorem}{HSC}).  We cannot say anymore based on the information provided, except to say that there is either a unique solution or infinitely many solutions (\acronymref{theorem}{PSSLS}). See \acronymref{archetype}{A} and \acronymref{archetype}{B} to understand the possibilities.
