This is a true statement.  A proof is:\par
%
($\Rightarrow$)  Suppose we have a homogeneous system $\homosystem{A}$.  Then by substituting the scalar zero for each variable, we arrive at true statements for each equation.  So the zero vector is a solution.  This is the content of \acronymref{theorem}{HSC}.\par
%
($\Leftarrow$)  Suppose now that we have a generic (i.e.\ not necessarily homogeneous) system of equations, $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ that has the zero vector as a solution.  Upon substituting this solution into the system, we discover that each component of $\vect{b}$ must also be zero.  So $\vect{b}=\zerovector$.
