\begin{enumerate}
%
\item Comment on how the vector space $\complex{m}$ went from a theorem (\acronymref{theorem}{VSPCV}) to an example (\acronymref{example}{VSCV}).
%
\item In the crazy vector space, $C$, (\acronymref{example}{CVS}) compute the linear combination
%
\begin{equation*}
2(3,\,4)+(-6)(1,\,2).
\end{equation*}
%
\item Suppose that $\alpha$ is a scalar and $\zerovector$ is the zero vector. Why should we prove anything as obvious as $\alpha\zerovector=\zerovector$ such as we did in \acronymref{theorem}{ZVSM}?
