\item Consider the two matrices below, and suppose you already have computed $\detname{A}=-120$.  What is $\detname{B}$?  Why?
\begin{align*}
A&=
\begin{bmatrix}
 0 & 8 & 3 & -4 \\
 -1 & 2 & -2 & 5 \\
 -2 & 8 & 4 & 3 \\
 0 & -4 & 2 & -3
\end{bmatrix}

B&=
\begin{bmatrix}
 0 & 8 & 3 & -4 \\
 0 & -4 & 2 & -3 \\
 -2 & 8 & 4 & 3 \\
 -1 & 2 & -2 & 5
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{align*}

\item State the theorem that allows us to make yet another extension to our NMEx series of theorems.
%
\item What is amazing about the interaction between matrix multiplication and the determinant?
