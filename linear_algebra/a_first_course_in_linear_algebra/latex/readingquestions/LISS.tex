\begin{enumerate}
%
\item Is the set of matrices below linearly independent or linearly dependent in the vector space $M_{22}$?  Why or why not?
%
\begin{equation*}
\set{
\begin{bmatrix}
1&3\\-2&4
\end{bmatrix},\,
\begin{bmatrix}
-2&3\\3&-5
\end{bmatrix},\,
\begin{bmatrix}
0&9\\-1&3
\end{bmatrix}
}
\end{equation*}
%
\item Explain the difference between the following two uses of the term ``span'':\\
(a) $S$ is a subset of the vector space $V$ and the span of $S$ is a subspace of $V$.\\
(b) $W$ is a subspace of the vector space $Y$ and $T$ spans $W$.
%
\item The set
%
\begin{equation*}
S=\set{
\colvector{6\\2\\1},\,
\colvector{4\\-3\\1},\,
\colvector{5\\8\\2}
}
\end{equation*}
%
is linearly independent and spans $\complex{3}$.  Write the vector
$\vect{x}=\colvector{-6\\2\\2}$ as a linear combination of the elements of $S$.  How many ways are there to answer this question, and which theorem allows you to say so?
