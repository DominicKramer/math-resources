%
\item The matrix below is nonsingular.  What can you now say about its columns?
%
\begin{equation*}
%
A= \begin{bmatrix}
-3 & 0 & 1\\
1 & 2 & 1\\
5 & 1 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
%
\end{equation*}
%
\item Write the vector $\vect{w}=\colvector{6\\6\\15}$ as a linear combination of the columns of the matrix $A$ above.  How many ways are there to answer this question?
%
\item Why is an orthonormal basis desirable?
