\begin{enumerate}
%
\item Suppose $\ltdefn{T}{\complex{8}}{\complex{5}}$ is a linear transformation.  Why can't $T$ be injective?
%
\item Describe the kernel of an injective linear transformation.
%
\item \acronymref{theorem}{KPI} should remind you of \acronymref{theorem}{PSPHS}.  Why do we say this?
