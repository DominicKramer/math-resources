\begin{enumerate}
\item How can we easily recognize when a system of linear equations is inconsistent or not?
\item Suppose we have converted the augmented matrix of a system of equations into reduced row-echelon form.  How do we then identify the dependent and independent (free) variables?
\item What are the possible solution sets for a system of linear equations?
\end{enumerate}
