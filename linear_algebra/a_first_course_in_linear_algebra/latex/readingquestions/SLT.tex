\begin{enumerate}
%
\item Suppose $\ltdefn{T}{\complex{5}}{\complex{8}}$ is a linear transformation.  Why can't $T$ be surjective?
%
\item What is the relationship between a surjective linear transformation and its range?
%
\item There are many similarities and differences between injective and surjective linear transformations.  Compare and contrast these two different types of linear transformations.  (This means going well beyond just stating their definitions.)
