\begin{enumerate}
%
\item Summarize the three conditions that allow us to quickly test if a set is a subspace.
%
\item Consider the set of vectors
%
\begin{align*}
W&=\setparts{\colvector{a\\b\\c}}{3a-2b+c=5}
\end{align*}
%
Is the set $W$ a subspace of $\complex{3}$?  Explain your answer.
%
\item Name five general constructions of sets of column vectors (subsets of $\complex{m}$) that we now know as subspaces.
