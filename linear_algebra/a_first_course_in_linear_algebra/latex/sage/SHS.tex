We can explore homogeneous systems easily in Sage with commands we have already learned.  Notably, the \verb?zero_vector()? constructor will quickly create the necessary vector of constants (\acronymref{sage}{V}).\par

You could try defining a function to accept a matrix as input, augment the matrix with a zero vector having the right number of entries, and then return the reduced row-echelon form of the augmented matrix, or maybe you could return the number of free variables. (See \acronymref{sage}{RCLS} for a refresher on how to do this).  It is also interesting to see how \verb?.solve_right()? behaves on homogeneous systems, since in particular we know it will never give us an error.  (Why not? Hint: \acronymref{theorem}{HSC}.)
