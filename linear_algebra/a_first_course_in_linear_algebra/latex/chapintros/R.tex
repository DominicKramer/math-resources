\begin{para}Previous work with linear transformations may have convinced you that we can convert most questions about linear transformations into questions about systems of equations or properties of subspaces of $\complex{m}$.  In this section we begin to make these vague notions precise.   We have used the word ``representation'' prior, but it will get a heavy workout in this chapter.  In many ways, everything we have studied so far was in preparation for this chapter.\end{para}
