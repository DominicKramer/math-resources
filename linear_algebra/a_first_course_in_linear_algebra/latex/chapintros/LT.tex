\begin{para}In the next linear algebra course you take, the first lecture might be a reminder about what a vector space is (\acronymref{definition}{VS}), their ten properties, basic theorems and then some examples.  The second lecture would likely be all about linear transformations.  While it may seem we have waited a long time to present what must be a central topic, in truth we have already been working with linear transformations for some time.\end{para}

\begin{para}Functions are important objects in the study of calculus, but have been absent from this course until now (well, not really, it just seems that way).  In your study of more advanced mathematics it is nearly impossible to escape the use of functions --- they are as fundamental as sets are.\end{para}
