This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<p>

<ul>
<li>In the statement of inverse function theorem, remove the definition of $q$, it is not used.
<li>In proof of second part of 10.4.3 (Riemann-Lebesgue) use $S_{1/k}$ rather than $S_k$ for
consistency with the first part of the proof.
<li>In the path integral chapter, consistently use the words "path integral"
rather than sometimes "path integral" sometimes "line integral".
<li>Mention that the nowhere differentiable function construction that we gave is due to Takagi
(although it is the one given in Rudin, not the form of it usually attributed to Takagi).
<li>Greatly simplify the function in example 11.6.4.
<li>In Exercise 11.6.1, the question should ask about there being no
  subsequence that converges uniformly just like 11.6.2.  The question is
  about why Arzel√†-Asoli fails.
</ul>
